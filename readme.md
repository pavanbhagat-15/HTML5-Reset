# HTML5 Reset

**HTML5 Reset** is a simple set of best practices to get web projects off on the right foot.

## STREAMLINED FOR 2023

1. **Minimal Opinionated Decisions**: The style sheet is designed to strip initial styles from browsers, providing a blank slate.
2. **No More Extra Libraries**: Removed Analytics, Modernizr, or jQuery.
3. **Basic CSS Variables**: Utilizes simple CSS variables for better maintainability.
4. **Useful Resources**: Links to helpful third-party tools.
5. **Cleaned Up Comments**: Removed extraneous comments for clarity.

## A Note on Font-Sizing

We prefer using `rem` for simplicity; however, you will need to swap in `em` in `styles.css` if that's your preferred style.

## Command-Line Installation

To install HTML5 Reset, run the following command:

```bash
bower install HTML5-Reset
